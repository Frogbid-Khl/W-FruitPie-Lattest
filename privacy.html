    <h2 style="font-size: 25px;">Introduce</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        These NFT Terms ("NFT Terms") apply to AseanKOC Limited. ("Issuer").<br>
        Sales through the Issuer's website, third-party websites, and blockchain-based applications (all of the preceding and
        functionality associated in addition to that), are collectively referred to as the "Platform" for Non-Fungible Tokens (“NFTs").
        The issuer (sometimes referred to herein as "we" or "our") may sell the NFT to its initial purchaser, and to the initial purchaser
        of the NFT and subsequent assignees (sometimes referred to herein as "our") you" or using similar terms), including but not
        limited to access to the Platform, provided that you accept these NFT Terms. These NFT terms are a binding contract between
        you and us. Your purchase, acquisition, and/or possession of NFTs through the Platform constitutes your full and unconditional
        agreement to the terms of these NFTs. We may update these NFT Terms by making new versions available online, and you will
        continue to use the Platform after any such update constitutes your binding acceptance of such changes. If you fail to comply
        with any NFT terms, we may immediately terminate our contract with you and your access to the Platform and any NFTs.
        Please read these NFT terms carefully before using the Platform. These NFT Terms will govern your use of the Platform unless
        we have entered into a separate written agreement with you for this purpose or provide specific terms. The Platform will only be
        available for your continued use if you accept all of these NFT terms.<br>
        If you accept these NFT terms on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you have the legal authority to accept these NFT
        terms on behalf of that entity, in which case "you" will refer to that entity. If you do not have such authority or do not accept all
        of these NFT terms, we will not be able to provide you with the Platform. If you do not agree to these NFT terms, you may not
        be able to access or use the Platform.<br>
        By entering, accessing, browsing, submitting information, or otherwise using the Platform or any portion thereof, you confirm
        that you understand and agree to be bound by the NFT Terms, and you represent and warrant that you are eighteen (18) years of
        age or older.
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 20px;">1. NFT purchase and ownership</h2><br>
    <h2 style="font-size: 18px;">1.1 NFTs we provide:</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        may include additional functionality, content, or subscription access to goods, services, and experiences where expressly stated
        in the description of such NFT;<br>
        It may be unique, part of a limited series, or may only be redeemed once;<br>
        may include the ability to receive goods, services, and experiences that may be unique or part of a limited collection or that can
        only be redeemed for a specified quantity or quantity of goods, services, and experiences;<br>
        maybe subject to additional terms or qualifications described in the NFT description; and applicable laws in effect from time to
        time.
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 18px;">1.2 Ownership of NFTs</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        "Own" means your right to NFTs purchased or otherwise legally acquired from legitimate sources, with proof of such purchases
        recorded on the applicable blockchain. For any NFT you own, you may hold the NFT according to any description that
        accompanies the NFT. Issuers may, at their option, use third-party platforms or wallet extensions (which may be owned or
        operated by third parties) to sell NFTs ("Third Party Sites"). You must agree to abide by any applicable terms of service or
        privacy policy that apply to your use of any third-party website<br>
        Unless otherwise stated in the description of the applicable NFT, the NFT you own will be transferable, but the terms of these
        NFTs will bind any assignee. The NFTS we offer are utility tokens associated with unique goods, services, and experiences. You
        should not purchase our NFTS for investment, resale, or speculative purposes; AseanKOC cannot guarantee their present or
        future value, transferability, or merchantability.<br>
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 18px;">1.3 Ownership of Creative Materials</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        You acknowledge and agree that the Publisher (or its licensors, as applicable) owns all right, title, and interest in any artwork,
        designs, drawings, photographs, labels, logos, badges, trademarks, trade dress, copyrights, formulas, etc. and may be related to
        Any other NFT-related creative materials you own (collectively, "Creative Materials"), and all intellectual property rights therein.
        Your rights in the Creative Materials are limited to those expressly set forth under "Intellectual Property Ownership, License, and
        Restrictions" below. Notwithstanding the purchase of an NFT, all rights, title, and interest in Issuer Intellectual Property (as
        defined below), including creative materials and other Issuer Intellectual Property, including all copyrights, contained in any NFT
        (including NFTs owned by you).
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 18px;">1.4 Risks of NFTs</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        Once you own any NFT, you will be responsible for any loss or damage to the NFT or inability to access the NFT, and neither the
        issuer nor any of its licensors shall be liable in such circumstances. You expressly understand and agree that your use of the
        Platform and any NFTs is at your own risk and that the Platforms and NFTs are provided "as is" and "as available."
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 18px;">1.5 Terms of Sale</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        All sales of NFTs are non-refundable once sold. Once you have purchased an NFT, you should immediately take the necessary
        steps to complete your transaction (e.g., activate or download any content or secure any mnemonic phrases or corresponding
        private keys). We encourage the use of secure offline storage for NFTs. You can buy NFTs with real or virtual/cryptocurrency,
        and you can use various payment methods. You may resell or otherwise transfer your NFTs as permitted by these NFT Terms
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 18px;">1.6 NFT Issuance</h2><br>
    <h2 style="font-size: 16px;">1.6.1 Fruit Party</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        Under the terms of these NFTs launching in May 2022, we will sell NFTs with a cap of 20,000 NFTs, each with a unique design
        based on the following characteristics:<br>
        Party cards, backgrounds, drum kits, drummers, guitarists, amps, beach chairs, saxophonists, umbrellas, and more, with over
        200 traits. We reserve the right to issue new NFTs and related merchandise and experiences in the future.<br>
        We will reserve 400 randomly minted NFTs for our team and partners and use them for giveaways and marketing.
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 16px;">1.6.2 Pricing</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        Each NFT is priced at 0.225 Ethereum (ETH). Buyers will be responsible for NFT minting/"gas" costs, which may incur additional
        sales tax.
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 16px;">1.6.3 Fresh Fruit Gift Box Released</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        Each NFT will include the right to receive two complimentary carefully selected fresh fruit gift boxes worth HKD 500.00
        (including shipping to all areas of Hong Kong (including outlying islands)) and fresh fruit gift boxes (each box, "Fresh Fruit Gift
        Box Release"). The right to obtain the Fresh Fruit Box distribution is subject to Section 1.6.5 of these NFT Terms.
        Additionally, NFT owners will be entitled to further Fruit Box issuances if the issuer's established cryptocurrency fund (the "Fresh
        Fruit Party Fund") receives sufficient funds to cover all NFT holders receiving the Fresh Fruit Box Issuance. The sources of
        funding for Fresh Fruit Party are as follows:<br>
        After all 20,000 NFTs have been sold, the issuer will contribute twenty (20) ETH to the Fresh Fruit Party Fund.
        A 5% royalties fee will be charged for secondary sales of NFTs, the entirety of which will be donated to the Fresh Fruit Party
        Fund.<br>
        The additional funds obtained as a percentage of profits from fresh fruit and merchandise sales will be determined at a later
        date.<br><br>
        The Issuer does not represent or warrant that the Fresh Fruit Box Fund will receive sufficient funds to fund any Fresh Fruit Box
        issuance, nor that the exchange rate between Ethereum and other currencies will be enough to support further Fresh Fruit Box
        issuances. If the Fresh Fruit Box Fund does not receive sufficient funds to fund new Fresh Fruit Box releases, or the value of
        Ethereum drops such that the funds in the Fresh Fruit Box Fund can no longer fund new Fresh Fruit Box releases (regardless of
        these funds) whether an earlier date would suffice), the Issuer is under no obligation to fund any fresh fruit box offerings.
        The fruit of the Fresh Fruit Gift Box will be packaged and shipped by a partner selected by the publisher. The exact details of
        each Fresh Fruit Box release will be at the sole discretion of the Fresh Fruit Box partner and Issuer, and NFT holders will accept
        no returns or exchanges.
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 16px;">1.6.4 Redemption Process</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        For each Fresh Fruit Gift Box, the Issuer will publicly announce the Fresh Fruit Gift Box's claim window (the "Go Live" date). NFT
        holders must declare their right to receive the Fresh Fruit Box issue by the date specified by the Issuer (the "Claim Deadline").
        The period between the launch date and the claim deadline will be referred to as the "Redemption Period").<br>
        Each Fresh Fruit Box release's exact date and time will be announced in the Announcements section of the publisher's Discord
        channel at http://discord.gg/fruitpie and the publisher's Twitter feed at http://twitter.com /fruit pie and via the publisher's email
        list. The monthly window periods for receiving fresh fruit gift boxes are as follows:<br><br>
        <b>Claim period A</b><br>
        Application window period: 08th to 10th of each month<br>
        ADelivery date: delivery on the 13th of each month<br><br>
        <b>Claim period B</b><br>
        Application window period: 25th to 27th of each month<br>
        Delivery date: delivery on the 28th of each month<br><br>

        Issuers are not obligated to notify NFT owners by any other means other than the above<br>
        Before each redemption period, the issuer will take a snapshot of all wallets holding NFTs. You are only entitled to the Fresh
        Fruit Box if you are the owner of the NFT at the time of the snapshot. If you purchase NFT after the snapshot, you will not be
        entitled to the applicable fresh fruit gift box. To collect your Fresh Fruit Gift Box authorization, please follow the steps below:
        Visit the "Claim Fruit" page at http://www.fruitpie.io/fruit-rewards.<br>
        Connect the wallet you use to hold NFTs via Metamask Wallet<br>
        After connecting your wallet, you will see how many fresh fruit gift boxes you can claim based on the number of NFTs you had
        at the snapshot.<br>
        Enter your shipping address, and if you are picking up multiple fresh fruit boxes, you can add multiple addresses for different
        shipments.
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 16px;">1.6.5 Eligible recipients and addresses</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        Fresh fruit gift boxes can be shipped to any area in Hong Kong and are currently closed to other countries and regions.

        Creative materials and all proprietary source code, object code, and other technologies related to NFTs, and
        All other content and materials, related applications, and the intellectual property (collectively, "Issuer Intellectual Property") are
        acquired through NFTs. The issuer's intellectual property may only be used for personal, non-commercial purposes related to
        the NFT, as expressly permitted by this NFT.
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 18px;">2.2 Use Restrictions.</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        Unless expressly stated otherwise, you should assume that all issuer intellectual property is protected by copyright, trademark,
        and other applicable intellectual property and may not be used except as permitted by these NFT terms without the issuer. Any
        other intellectual property rights may be owned.
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 18px;">2.3 License Grant: Platform</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        The Publisher grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to access and use the Platform solely for
        your personal, non-commercial use. You may not use the Platform for any illegal purpose. We reserve all rights to neutralize the
        Platform under these NFT terms not expressly granted to you
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 18px;">2.4 License Grant: NFTs and Creative Materials.</h2><br>
    <h2 style="font-size: 16px;">2.4.1 Personal Use.</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        Without limiting the generality of the above, and subject to your continued compliance with these NFT
        terms, the Issuer grants you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to display the creative materials of
        your NFTs, only for the following purposes:<br>
        for your personal, non-commercial use; or<br>
        The marketplace cryptographically verifies each NFT owner's right to display creative materials, ensuring that only the actual
        owner of the NFT can display innovative materials.
    </p><br>

    <h2 style="font-size: 16px;">2.4.2. Commercial use</h2><br>
    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">
        Without limiting the generality of the above, and subject to your continued compliance with these NFT terms, the Publisher
        grants you an unlimited worldwide license to use, reproduce and display the purchased artwork to create derivative works based
        on the creative materials ( "business use"). An example of such commercial use is innovative materials to produce and sell
        merchandise (T-shirts, etc.) that display copies of the innovative materials. For clarity, nothing in this section will be deemed to
        restrict you from<br>
        (i) owning or operating a marketplace that allows the use and sale of NFTs, provided that the market cryptographically verifies
        each NFT owner's right to display creative material. Have their NYFT ensure that only the actual owner can display innovative
        material;<br>
        (ii) own or operate a third-party website or application that generally allows NFTs to include, participate, or participate, provided
        that the third-party website or application cryptographically authenticates each The right of the NFT owner to display his NFT
        creative material ensures that only the actual owner can show the creative material, and once the owner of the purchased NFT
        leaves the website/app, the innovative material will no longer be visible;(iii) earn income from any of the above. Provided that the
        third-party website or application cryptographically verifies the right of each NFT owner to display creative materials for their
        NFT, to ensure that only the actual owner can show the innovative materials, and once the owner of the creative materials is no
        longer visible to the purchased NFT leave the website/app;<br>
        (iii) earn income from any of the above. Provided that the third-party website or application cryptographically verifies the right
        of each NFT owner to display creative materials for their NFT, to ensure that only the actual owner can show the innovative
        materials, and once the owner of the creative materials is no longer visible to the purchased NFT leave the website/app;

    <p class="leading-relaxed md:text-lg md:w-3/4 lg:w-full undefined" style="font-size: 16px;">

        cryptocurrency, or changes to the way transactions are confirmed on the Ethereum blockchain could have unintended adverse effects on all
        blockchains using these or similar technologies, including NFTs.<br>
